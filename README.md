### Project 1: [DefiSocialMedia](https://github.com/Xanawer/DefiSocialMedia)

Decentralized Social Media (DSM)

Welcome to the Decentralized Social Media (DSM) platform! Our mission is to redefine the social media landscape by putting user privacy and data security at the forefront of our operations. 

Unlike traditional social media platforms, DSM is mounted on the Ethereum blockchain, providing unparalleled transparency and user control. Our decentralized structure ensures that the user data isn't owned by a central authority. Instead, users have full control over their data, how it's shared, and who can access it.

Key Features:

- **Privacy**: With DSM, your data remains yours. Only you control who can access your information.
- **Security**: Thanks to the Ethereum blockchain, every transaction and interaction is securely recorded and immutable.
- **Transparency**: With a publicly accessible blockchain, every transaction can be audited, ensuring unparalleled transparency.
- **Censorship Resistant**: Being decentralized, DSM is resilient to censorship. Your voice will always be heard.
- **Advertisment Revenue Split**: Your post can become monetized if it generates enough ad-revenue. This is paid out in our own DefiCoin. 

DSM is not just a social media platform; it's a revolution in how we think about and interact with social media. Get started today and experience the future of social media!
